## Why

When I saw Ben Eater's video about a [video card on a breadboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs), I was amazed by how "simple" it was to create the signals needed to drive a VGA display. I wanted to try it myself, but I didn't want to recreate it just for the sake of it, without a real use case.  
Se, when we had to choose a project for our microelectronics course, I decided to base my design on Ben Eater's video card, but with a twist : it had to be small enough to fit on a TinyTapeout Design slot.
